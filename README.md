# Mobile System for Monitorization of Noise Pollution
### End of Degree Project
#### Software Engineering, University of MÃ¡laga

### Description

The main goal of this project is to create a cheap and mobile system that can measure the noise pollution in the environment.
As easy as bringing a configured Arduino board with you while you take a walk will get the noise pollution and send it to our system (sending it to your phone via Bluetooth that will forward it to the API).
Meanwhile, any user can see a realtime heatmap with all the noise pollution data received.
